        <section>
          <p>
            The press conference focused on the public information provided by
            the University regarding collaborations with Israeli academic
            institutions and our subsequent actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from the press conference, a meeting was held on the topic of
            racism in Poland.
          </p>
          <p>Text Delivered at the Press Conference:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              On July 19, 2024, we received a list of collaborations between the
              University of Wroc≈Çaw and Israeli academic institutions, research
              centers, and other organizations and companies. This is
              potentially the first demand we have achieved, interestingly,
              without engaging in negotiations‚Äîbecause we requested the list
              through a public information request, leaving the university no
              choice but to create and share the document. The University of
              Wroc≈Çaw was unable to complete this within the legally stipulated
              time, sending the document after extending the review period,
              after 47 days.
            </p>
            <p>
              Interestingly, it took us, the protesting students, just 13 days
              to compile such a list, and on June 16, we published the related
              information on our social media channels. Moreover, our notes from
              that day, based on grassroots student research without access to
              the university's database, are far more detailed and comprehensive
              than those provided to us by the University of Wroc≈Çaw. This is
              mainly because, unlike the document provided by the university,
              our notes contain information on the nature of the collaborations,
              the projects involved, the budget, specific coordinators, and the
              start and end dates of the research.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not understand why the university administration needed much
              more time than the legally mandated two weeks to create a document
              containing three sentences related to collaborations, which lack
              specific information that would allow us to understand the actual
              scope of the collaboration between the University of Wroc≈Çaw and
              Israeli institutions. In our opinion, this is yet another
              expression of the university authorities' incompetence and further
              evidence that the University of Wroc≈Çaw's Rectorate, in our
              opinion, does not take the student protest seriously. This is
              mainly because we believe the document provided does not fulfill
              its function of accurately detailing the scope of collaborations.
              Without this, it is impossible to assess how feasible it is for
              the University of Wroc≈Çaw to terminate these collaborations and
              what legal acts bind the agreements between our university and
              Israeli institutions. Looking at the list provided by the
              University of Wroc≈Çaw, we wonder whether the lack of specifics is
              an attempt to make it more difficult for us to prove our case‚Äîthat
              breaking off these collaborations is morally necessary and legally
              possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this reason, we would like to present what we believe a
              document providing a list of collaborations between the University
              of Wroc≈Çaw and Israeli institutions and companies should look
              like. Using examples of such documents from Leiden University and
              the University of Ljubljana, we would like to present to you, and
              to the University of Wroc≈Çaw administration, a document that, by
              gathering specific and detailed information, allows for the
              beginning of substantive negotiations and discussions about
              meeting our demands. We see this public presentation of
              information, which the University of Wroc≈Çaw chose not to disclose
              in its letter, as an invitation to engage in a substantive and
              factual discussion about implementing the demands we have made.
            </p>
            <p>In the University of Wroc≈Çaw document, we read:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                In response to the public information request submitted to the
                University of Wroc≈Çaw on June 3, 2024, pursuant to the Act of
                September 6, 2001, on Access to Public Information (Journal of
                Laws of 2022, item 902), regarding the cooperation of the
                University of Wroc≈Çaw with Israeli academic institutions,
                research centers, and other organizations and companies, I
                hereby indicate that the University of Wroc≈Çaw cooperates with
                the following entities:
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Naturally, we have no objections to this part.</p>
            <p>
              The first collaboration mentioned in the document is, quoting the
              University of Wroc≈Çaw's response:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <ol>
                <li>The Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel:</li>
              </ol>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In the field of implementing an effective combination of
                  medications to improve therapy against
                  <i lang="lat">Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> ‚Äì the bacteria causing
                  pneumonia.
                </li>
                <li>Cooperation in the exchange of students and staff.</li>
              </ul>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              In our opinion, apart from the fact that the University of
              Wroc≈Çaw's document lacks specific and substantive information, it
              relies solely on a laconic sentence that closes off any
              possibility of discussion in the context of our proposed demand to
              sever cooperation with Israeli academic institutions. Therefore,
              we believe the collaboration should be presented as follows:
            </p>

                The Hebrew University of Jerusalem was involved in introducing
                typhus bacteria into rivers in villages from which Palestinians
                had already been expelled to prevent their return and also to
                poison water sources in residential areas where the Palestinian
                population still lived.<sup

              </li>

              <li>
                The university led archaeological excavations that displaced
                Palestinians, conducted on occupied Palestinian territories,
                focusing on highlighting Jewish history at the expense of
                concealing Palestinian history.<sup

                In 2018, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem won a tender to run
                an elite study program for soldiers of the Intelligence Corps as
                part of their military training. Winning the tender meant
                meeting increased military requirements, specifically
                significant military intervention in the program's content,
                structure, staff, and campus infrastructure. Students in the
                program sleep, study, and eat in a dormitory designated as a
                "closed military base." Few faculty members opposed the
                program's launch, but Palestinian students who filmed a protest
                against the program's continuation were attacked by right-wing
                student groups, and the university authorities demanded the
                material be removed from the internet.<sup

                The Hebrew University of Jerusalem trains Shin Bet personnel‚Äîthe
                internal security service‚Äîresponsible for implementing the
                Lavender program, used by the Israeli army in Gaza to facilitate
                the bombing of non-military targets and classifying specific
                individuals, including independent journalists, as "force
                targets," allowing for the killing of 20 to 100 civilian
                casualties as "collateral damage" in strikes on these so-called
                targets.<sup

                The university's criminology department advertises itself as a
                pioneer in "counter-terrorism" science, promoting "proven in
                practice" strategies. These strategies have been condemned
                internationally for violating Palestinians' rights.<sup

                The university participated in the systematic and illegal
                expropriation of Palestinian land as part of the national

            <p>
              Returning to the University of Wroc≈Çaw document, the second
              mentioned cooperation is:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li value="2">
                Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    In the field of research on innovative nuclear receptor
                    particles in the fight against cancer recurrence.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    An agreement was made to promote scientific progress through
                    research exchange and cooperation in teaching through the
                    exchange of students, lecturers, and staff, organizing joint
                    lectures and seminars, and research projects.
                  </li>
                  <li>Cooperation in the exchange of students and staff.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              The lack of specifics in describing this cooperation almost makes
              it impossible to create our version of the document. There is no
              information on whether the mentioned agreement in the second point
              is an individual agreement between universities or perhaps part of
              a project like NAWA or another international project. We also do
              not know if we are talking about the entire University of Wroc≈Çaw
              or specific units (e.g., the Institute of Mathematics or the
              Department of Jewish Studies, where researchers from Ben-Gurion
              University are hosted). We do not know the agreement's budget, its
              nature, expiration date, or any details regarding its scope. In
              our opinion, this makes it impossible to accurately understand the
              legislative nature of the cooperation because we do not know which
              legal acts bind and condition this cooperation.
            </p>

            <p>
              This puts the actual fulfillment of our demand, in our opinion,
              into question, as the scope of cooperation has not been presented
              to us by the University of Wroc≈Çaw authorities. After all, we did
              not request public information from the University of Wroc≈Çaw to
              receive information that we could find ourselves and, indeed, have
              found. We expected the university authorities to take our request
              seriously and, following the example of Western universities,
              create a list containing precise information that could be
              translated into discussions about the ethics of the undertaken
              collaborations and the necessity of potentially terminating them
              in light of current events.
            </p>

            <p>
              Nevertheless, we found much more detailed information regarding
              the first mentioned collaboration with Ben-Gurion University,
              which we believe should be described as follows:

                to offer the Israeli government advice on issues critical to the
                state's "national security agenda," such as creating innovative
                legal interpretations that protect Israel from accountability

                disproportionate force" including the destruction of "economic
                assets," "civilian centers of power," and "state infrastructure"

              Frankly, we find it difficult to understand why the university
              administration took so long to create this type of document, which
              in our opinion, more closely resembles a note rather than an
              actual presentation of the scope of collaborations. Moreover, we
              are also concerned by the fact that the International Cooperation
              Office's website lists Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan<sup
                ><a id="d75-foonote-ref-21" href="#d75-footnote-21">21</a></sup
              >
              among the Partner Country universities in the Erasmus+ program for
              teaching staff exchanges, in addition to the three universities
              mentioned in the University of Wroc≈Çaw document. Based on publicly
              available data, it is difficult to determine whether the
              University of Wroc≈Çaw failed to disclose one of the collaborations
              in response to the public information request or did not remove an
              already expired collaboration from its website. However, both
              situations, in our opinion, reflect the university's incompetence,
              and we understand the collaborations listed on the official
              website as still ongoing and therefore binding. We kindly request
              the university to address this discrepancy.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, we repeat once again, we are not here for legislative
              squabbles, boasting about our knowledge and ability to find
              information. The document and statement we have issued should be
              seen, once again, as an attempt to initiate substantive
              discussions based on concrete data, arguments, and facts. In the
              current situation, we should not allow ourselves only to engage
              in, what we believe to be, empty words that obviously cannot
              translate into substantive discussion and real action.
            </p>

            <p>
              Regarding these matters, we believe that our protest must expand
              its activities. Constantly observing the actions of the Israeli
              army in Gaza, we are increasingly horrified by the scale of the
              calculated and direct targeting of educational institutions and
              academic and teaching staff. To grasp the scale of the destruction
              and tragedy, it is enough to say that there is no longer a
              university in Gaza, no one has access to education, and final
              exams in high schools have not taken place. The statistics on
              casualties among rectors, scientists, teachers, students, pupils,
              and preschoolers are all the more horrifying and dramatic.
            </p>

            <p>
              Therefore, in the face of ongoing scholarly genocide, we have
              decided to issue another demand, in which we call on the
              University of Wroc≈Çaw to support the Palestinian academic
              community by:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Facilitating the recognition of Palestinian high school
                graduation exams (Tawjihi) to enable studying at the University
                of Wroc≈Çaw and expanding the number of places for foreigners
                with a dedicated number for candidates of Palestinian origin.
              </li>
              <li>
                Creating support pathways for Palestinian students in the areas
                of tuition fee waivers, providing dormitory places for arriving
                students (regardless of the time of arrival in Wroc≈Çaw),
                establishing a financial aid system to ensure decent living
                conditions, providing health insurance, and covering
                international travel costs related to coming to Wroc≈Çaw for
                education.
              </li>
              <li>
                Assisting Palestinian academic staff by creating residency
                programs, organizing temporary employment opportunities at the
                University of Wroc≈Çaw, providing access to UWr infrastructure
                for research, collaborating on research projects, and
                co-organizing scientific conferences.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Funding for this support should be provided through dedicated
              funds.
            </p>

            <p>
              We hope that this approach demonstrates that our protest should
              not be ignored and that discussions should begin as soon as
              possible. We look forward to welcoming Palestinian students to the
              University of Wroc≈Çaw in October, with concrete support and the
              implementation of significant solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
              It turns out that we‚Äîthe protesting students‚Äîare not the only ones
              who see the necessity of starting talks with the University of
              Wroc≈Çaw authorities as soon as possible. This view is shared by,
              among others, Janina Ochojska, Professor Magdalena ≈öroda,
              Professor Mieke Bal, Przemys≈Çaw Wielgosz, Professor Dorota
              G≈Çowacka, and Professor Ariella Aisha Azoulay, who want to support
              us by conducting lectures, discussions, and workshops on the
              grounds of our protest. Meanwhile, Maya Wind, author of
              <i>Towers of Ivory and Steel</i>, will support us with closed and
              consultative meetings regarding negotiations. Some of the
              aforementioned have signed an open letter supporting our actions
              and calling on the Rector of the University of Wroc≈Çaw to start
              talks. The letter can still be signed, and today, right after the
              conference, we will share it on our social media channels.
            </p>

            <p>Thank you very much, and we encourage you to ask questions.</p>

            At 1:00 PM, a solidarity march for Palestine set off from Prƒôgierz.
            During the demonstration, the market square was circled twice, and
            then the march proceeded down Ku≈∫nicza Street to University Square,
            stopping at the Swordsman monument. Here are the speeches delivered
            during the protest:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              "I‚Äôll start by thanking you for your presence. I‚Äôm glad you found
              the time to be here. Your being here shows that the Palestinian
              issue is important enough to you that you want to do something
              about it, and you have the opportunity to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
              I suspect that different emotions and intentions brought us here.
              Some of us may feel anger, some deep sadness, some fear for the
              future. Or maybe you‚Äôre not entirely sure what you feel, but
              something prompted you to show up here. Whatever those feelings
              may be, I think it‚Äôs important not to ignore them but to sometimes
              examine them and maybe try to use them.
            </p>
            <p>
              When 27 years ago, in the year my older sister was born, 1997,
              Wroc≈Çaw was flooded by the flood of the millennium, thousands of
              volunteers built barricades of sandbags, trying to stop the rising
              Oder River. People helped each other evacuate flooded buildings,
              deliver food and water, and finally clean up after the devastation
              caused by the river. As with many other disasters and
              catastrophes, the tragedy that struck the people of Wroc≈Çaw
              awakened in them a spirit of solidarity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using this example, I propose a change in perspective: what if the
              whole world is Wroc≈Çaw, and Palestine is its sinking market
              square?
            </p>
            <p>
              If we look at all the beings living on Earth as one big community,
              we can feel the same spirit of solidarity that drives us to act
              when a disaster shakes our local community. Thanks to technology
              that allows us to connect with almost every corner of this planet,
              this is even easier today. We just have to want to see it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yesterday, I had the opportunity to participate in an online
              meeting with Adnan Barq, which took place at the University of
              Wroc≈Çaw occupation at Szewska 50/51. Adnan is a Palestinian from
              Jerusalem, a social media creator. During the meeting, I listened
              to his experiences in a city where his status as a human being was
              taken away. I listened to the rigorous, violent checks and
              searches he went through several times a day on his way to
              university, as Jerusalem and Bethlehem, where he studied, are
              separated by a wall. I listened to the terror that afflicts
              Palestinians on the streets of that city, caused by their mere
              presence there. When someone asked Adnan what he, as a
              Palestinian, feels about international solidarity movements, he
              replied that these movements are what keep him alive every day.
            </p>
            <p>
              From this place, I urge you to act. To attend demonstrations, to
              support local solidarity initiatives, to learn about Palestinian
              culture, and to spread the truth that what is happening there is a
              planned, systematic genocide and ethnic cleansing. Following
              Adnan, I urge you to act in the real world, not just the virtual
              one. Because the people whose tear-streaked faces and battered
              bodies we see on social media cry and die in the real world. And
              only by acting in the real world can we influence their situation.
            </p>
            <p>
              It may seem that a small demonstration in some Wroc≈Çaw has little
              to do with the hell that is unfolding in Gaza. But I remind you of
              the comparison from the flood example. Every small act is like a
              single sandbag forming a dam. It is part of something bigger, and
              that is its value.
            </p>
            <p>
              A good example that illustrates the power of many small actions is
              the boycott. Four days ago, I learned that for the first time in
              over three years (and remember, over three years ago, there was a
              lockdown), McDonald‚Äôs announced a global decline in sales. This is
              linked to the consumer boycott in response to McDonald‚Äôs support
              for the Israeli military. As this example shows, if each of us is
              a grain of sand, when there are enough of us, together, we will
              build a dam.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, I encourage you once again to examine the emotions that
              brought you here today. I believe that if you feel them, you are
              somewhat aware that we are all part of one big community. Then
              think about what those emotions are telling you, which sandbag you
              want to add to. And when you decide, don‚Äôt be afraid to join that
              dam.
            </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              "Today marks the 63rd day since we, the students, began the
              occupation of the University of Wroc≈Çaw. I will not lament the
              state of this institution, which failed to engage in a simple
              conversation. We are not thinking about the problems that come
              with stepping out of line, for we have no fear. There is no doubt
              in the words you hear. We have no doubt that our cries, disrupting
              conversations over Sunday dinner, are needed by all of us. We have
              no doubt as we take each step, demonstrating our opposition to
              genocide, and we do not hesitate when we hold the flag of a
              country whose fate will be the fate of us all.

              They can try to silence us‚Äîstudents‚Äîwith the police, as happened
              in Warsaw. They can suppress our voices with ignorance. They can
              destroy our actions with physical and symbolic violence. They can
              stifle our voices about the deaths of thousands of innocent
              children. They can hound us with the press that paints us however
              it wants. But we will not give up; we will not leave without
              reaching an agreement with the university authorities. You will
              hear our voices in the sun and rain; we will stand here when the
              leaves start to fall on our heads, we will march in more
              demonstrations, leaving footprints in the snow. We will not give
              up because there is no alternative to a free world, no alternative
              to refusing to accept genocide. We cannot agree to systemic
              dehumanization, to Israel‚Äôs genocidal policies. We cannot remain
              silent when the value of human life is being erased from the pages
              of history‚Äîanyone‚Äôs life, at any time.

              world. The border is the value of human life, and that border must
              never be crossed. This must not be forgotten by all those who
              represent us‚Äîordinary citizens. Russia has forgotten this; Israel
              has forgotten this. There is no hope for a society that accepts
              genocide. Let us not allow those who do not see us as humans to
              win. To think about the future, we must reflect on the past. Are
              we really living in the 21st century, and did the 20th century
              really teach us anything?
            </p>
            <p>
              The Palestinian issue is not a story from distant lands. The
              history of Palestine is also the history of the struggle against
              the banality of evil. Every day we make a decision on which side
              of the conflict we stand. Every day we decide whether we oppose
              genocide or remain silent. Silently condoning the bombing of
              hospitals, schools, universities, homes, and refugee camps. We
              cannot imagine the sound of drones overhead, which could signal
              death at any moment. We cannot understand the emotions of someone
              searching for the bodies of their loved ones in the rubble of
              their city. We cannot imagine a world engulfed by evil, devoid of
              our privilege of life and self-determination. That‚Äôs why every day
              we try to break the silence of the Western world, to shout on
              behalf of those whose voices have disappeared in the sound of
              falling bombs. This shout disrupts the existing order, revealing
              the hypocrisy of the Western world. The veil of the mirror falls,
              revealing the truth. In the West, nothing changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Are we ready to live together, or will we continue to die for the
              place of our birth, for the language in which our parents spoke to
              us, for the photographs of our grandparents, for the colors of the
              bricks from which our churches are built? To move forward, calling
              ourselves human beings, we must take the Palestinian issue to
              heart and shout with all the strength in our lungs on behalf of
              those whose home has become hell on earth. Poland cannot be free
              when Putin is murdering civilians next door, the world cannot be
              free without a free Palestine, which is the last bastion of the
              fight against the crimes of colonialism, against the crimes of
              apartheid, against what is supposedly long behind us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Palestine must win, and we must continually support its fight for
              freedom. Without a free Palestine, there is no free world.
              <i>No one is free until everbody is free</i>."

            An online meeting took place with Palestinian content creator and
            journalist Adnan Barq (Instagram:
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/adnan.barq/">@adnan.barq</a>).
            Adnan shares his experiences as a Palestinian living in Jerusalem on
            his profile and raises awareness about the events unfolding there.
            During the meeting with Adnan, participants explored the question of
            whether there is room for mourning during genocide.
          </p>
          <p>
            On this day, two months of student occupation at the University of
            Wroc≈Çaw also passed. In that time alone, 3,125 people have died in
            the Gaza Strip. Despite the ongoing genocide and the cultural
            genocide committed by Israel against the Palestinian people, and
            despite the International Court of Justice‚Äôs ruling on July 19,
            2024, confirming Israel‚Äôs violation of international law through
            years of land confiscations and forced displacement of Palestinians,
            the university authorities remain indifferent to our actions and
            requests for dialogue. We will not give up, and we will continue our
            actions until we are heard and our demands become the subject of
            discussions with the university authorities.
          </p>
          <p>
            These two months would not have been possible without the
            perseverance of the occupiers and the many people supporting us in
            various ways. We thank everyone who has been and continues to be
            with us; it is also thanks to you that we can keep going. Long live
            a free Palestine!

            In front of the building at Szewska 50/51, a press conference was

          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <h4>
              "NATIONAL DELEGATES' ASSEMBLY OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF
              STRIKE, OCCUPATION, AND PROTEST COMMITTEES 'ACADEMIA FOR
              PALESTINE'
            </h4>
            <p>
              In light of the Western world‚Äôs indifference to the genocide
              carried out by Israel in the Gaza Strip and the occupation of
              Palestine, we, Polish students, oppose the apathy and turning a
              blind eye to the suffering of Palestinians.
            </p>
            <p>
              From July 26-29, the First National Assembly of Delegates of the
              National Association of Strike, Occupation, and Protest Committees
              'Academia for Palestine' took place. The indifference of Polish
              rectors forced students to take action against the genocide in
              Gaza and the occupation of Palestine. We were compelled to hold
              these discussions by KRASP‚Äôs inaction and their inability to
              address all of our demands substantively. As students of Adam
              Mickiewicz University, University of Gda≈Ñsk, Jagiellonian
              University, Maria Curie-Sk≈Çodowska University, University of
              Warsaw, and University of Wroc≈Çaw, we demand that the rectors of
              our universities take more decisive action in the face of the
              ongoing genocide and cultural genocide in the Gaza Strip, rather
              than the symmetrical condemnation of 'both sides of the conflict,'
              which was included in KRASP‚Äôs statement on May 20. For this
              reason, on July 5, 2024, we sent a letter to the Conference of
              Rectors of Academic Schools in Poland, again demanding:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The public, firm, and unequivocal condemnation of the Israeli
                government‚Äôs attack on the Gaza Strip and the occupation of
                Palestine.
              </li>
              <li>
                A call to the member universities to sever ties with Israeli
                academic institutions and other organizations and companies
                associated with the occupation of Palestine and the ongoing
                genocide in the Gaza Strip and to boycott Israeli institutions
                at the national and international levels until the occupation of
                Palestine ends.
              </li>
              <li>
                The provision by the member universities of information on the
                entities with which they cooperate and to what extent. This
                demand is equivalent to submitting a request under the Public
                Information Act to the following universities: John Paul II
                Catholic University of Lublin, University of Gda≈Ñsk, Adam
                Mickiewicz University in Pozna≈Ñ, Jagiellonian University, Jan
                D≈Çugosz University in Czƒôstochowa, Jan Kochanowski University in
                Kielce, Cardinal Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski University, Kazimierz Wielki
                University in Bydgoszcz, University of ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Maria
                Curie-Sk≈Çodowska University, Nicolaus Copernicus University in
                Toru≈Ñ, University of Opole, John Paul II Pontifical University
                in Krak√≥w, University of Rzesz√≥w, University of Silesia,
                University of Szczecin, University of Bia≈Çystok, University of
                Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, University of Warsaw, University
                of Wroc≈Çaw, and University of Zielona G√≥ra.
              </li>
              <li>
                A call to the Rector of the University of Warsaw, Prof. Alojzy
                Nowak, to drop criminal charges against protesting students.
              </li>
              <li>
                A call to the rectors of member universities to begin public
                negotiations with protesting students.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Prof. Bogumi≈Ça Kaniewska, Chair of KRASP, and Prof. Piotr
              Stƒôpniowski, Chair-Elect, have consciously decided to address only
              the first demand, completely ignoring the other four. KRASP did
              not respond to our invitation to meet with the strikers, which was
              to take place today at 2:00 PM. Despite the lack of response, we
              are ready for negotiations and to welcome KRASP representatives,
              as preparations for the meeting have been underway since Friday.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, negotiating with KRASP is no longer our priority. The
              rapid pace at which cultural genocide is progressing in Gaza does
              not allow us to wait and see if the rectors of Polish universities
              will decide to take any action on this issue. From October to May
              2024, 94 academics and at least 5,480 students and 260 teachers
              were killed in Gaza, with more than 7,800 students and more than
              750 teachers injured. All 12 universities in Gaza and 476 schools
              were destroyed by bombings. At least 713,000 students in the Gaza
              Strip have been deprived of access to education. We will no longer
              wait for KRASP‚Äôs decision on whether the scale of destruction in
              Gaza deserves their attention‚Äîevery day of inaction in this matter
              leads to new murders of civilians, including the Palestinian
              academic community, which is strategically targeted by Israel.
              Therefore, we have decided to take further steps.
            </p>
            <p>
              As part of the Delegates' Assembly, we participated in the 'Voices
              for Palestine' video conference, during which Palestinian women,
              who have experienced Israel‚Äôs genocidal policies and war crimes,
              shared their stories of fleeing and living in exile, and the
              tragedy of losing their homes and homeland.
            </p>
            <p>
              Conversations with the direct victims of Israeli violence, hearing
              their stories and appeals, have reinforced the need to expand the
              scope of our actions. We consider the summer vacation period an
              excellent time to start discussions and propose solutions that
              could contribute to helping rebuild Palestine after the end of
              Israel‚Äôs military operations, including the cultural genocide that
              led to the destruction of the academic community and the
              annihilation of Palestinian university infrastructure. We plan
              actions aimed at enabling Palestinians to continue their education
              and support their training in safe conditions at Polish
              universities. For this reason, the National Delegates' Assembly
              (National Association of Strike, Occupation, and Protest
              Committees) 'Academia for Palestine' has decided to expand its
              activities beyond the academic level. The nearly three-month
              activity of the student movement has demonstrated our
              determination and fighting spirit, which has allowed us to engage
              three more universities that have joined the Council and a dozen
              others that have sent open letters to their university rectors.
              Today, July 29, we declare that our struggle continues and will
              continue‚Äîbut no longer just at universities and academies. We will
              do everything we can to ensure that our protest contributes to
              real, effective help for the Palestinian victims of Israel‚Äôs
              offensive operations in the Gaza Strip.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next National Delegates' Assembly will take place in the
              second half of August in Krak√≥w."

              "Greetings to everyone gathered here. I officially open this
              assembly. As one of the students participating in the peaceful
              occupation of the University of Wroc≈Çaw, I would like to say a few
              words.
            </p>

            <p>
              On the 55th day of our occupation, 80% of the Gaza Strip lies in
              ruins, devastated by Israeli bombs, rockets, and bulldozers. There
              are no longer any universities there, and only a few schools
              remain. Since we‚Äôve been here, 2,805 Palestinians have been
              murdered‚Äînot only by bullets or being crushed under rubble but
              also through starvation, as humanitarian convoys are blocked.
              These numbers do not fully convey the scale of Palestine‚Äôs
              suffering, as the full extent is still not fully known.
            </p>

            <p>
              We will not be silent about these crimes. In the face of ignorance
              and inaction by the university authorities, we will remain here.
            </p>

            <p>
              Standing here in defense of human life, in solidarity with all
              students around the world, especially those whose peaceful
              protests were brutally suppressed by the police.
            </p>

            <p>
              Standing here in solidarity with Palestine, with all its people in
              Gaza and beyond, and with those who were murdered for the 'crime'
              of their birth.
            </p>

            <p>
              We want to say stop to genocide, stop to silence, stop to
              cooperation with war criminals. Never again, for anyone."

              This is my third visit to the Wroc≈Çaw occupation. Each time, I am
              deeply impressed by the fighting spirit, determination, and
              enthusiasm of the occupiers in Wroc≈Çaw, despite the wall of
              silence and ignorance erected by the university authorities.
            </p>

            <p>
              Two and a half months ago, I never dreamed we would last this
              long; I never dreamed so many cities would join our protest; I
              never dreamed I would meet people from countries around the world
              united by our shared struggle for a free Palestine.
            </p>

            <p>
              If the rectors are ignoring us, they are contradicting the very
              principles they claim to uphold. Shouldn‚Äôt a university be a place
              of learning, not ignorance? Is silencing and suppressing critical
              voices the goal of a university? Is turning a blind eye to human
              suffering a value cultivated in Polish academia? The Conference of
              Rectors of Academic Schools in Poland (KRASP) seems to confirm
              this with its passivity, indifference, and ignorance. The
              invitation we extended to the rectors of our universities was met
              with silence. The rectors are trying to create a narrative that we
              are demanding, aggressive, and to be feared, yet they still ignore
              us. Ignoring us for two months has achieved little‚Äîour
              determination has not waned, and we continue our fight, which will
              last until Palestine is free. Because none of us is free until all
              of us are free. Long live a free Palestine!"

              "Hello. I am one of the students at Jagiellonian University, and
              along with my friends, I have been occupying the Faculty of
              Philosophy at Collegium Broscianum in Krak√≥w for over two months.
              The keffiyeh I am wearing right now was given to me by a
              Palestinian at the first solidarity protest organized by the
              Krak√≥w for Palestine collective in October. Since then, I‚Äôve tried
              to wear it all the time. I was wearing it when I joined the
              occupation of Jagiellonian University, which had only been going
              on for two days at that point. Today is the 65th day of the
              strike. Despite the summer break, pressure, and difficulties from
              the university authorities, despite many tough days and even
              tougher nights, we are still there, still maintaining the
              occupation at Collegium Broscianum. Because no matter what we
              experience, what the Palestinians experience is unimaginably
              worse. We are still there because we refuse to be silent, to look
              away, and we refuse to let our universities support genocide and
              legitimize this colonial killing machine. The situation in Krak√≥w
              is somewhat different from Wroc≈Çaw. Our rectors talk to us, which
              seems to be an anomaly in the Polish academic scene. This does not
              mean they are willing to take any action to sever ties with Israel
              or fulfill our demands, but apparently, the bar is set so low that
              we consider it exceptional when a rector deigns to step down from
              his pedestal and talk to students, rather than a rule. It is
              simply unacceptable that a rector is afraid of his own students
              and refuses to talk to them. We hear so much about the university
              being a community, but in a community, people talk to each other,
              including rectors. So where is that dialogue you keep talking
              about?
            </p>

            <p>
              And as much as I like to complain about them, we cannot lose sight
              of our goal‚Äîto make every possible effort to ensure that the
              genocide and occupation of Palestine end once and for all. That‚Äôs
              why I wear this keffiyeh almost every day. I want to remember what
              has been lost and what can still be saved. The people who died and
              those who are still alive. The culture and the knowledge. During
              those first protests, as we walked through the streets of Krak√≥w‚Äôs
              Old Town, they were filled with the voices of the Palestinian
              diaspora demanding freedom for themselves, their country, and
              their culture. I want to remember that image for the rest of my
              life. Remember that, no matter what, we must keep fighting.
              Because no one will be free until Palestine is free."

              "Hello. We are a delegation from the Pozna≈Ñ movement Students for
              Justice in Palestine. First, we would like to thank the Wroc≈Çaw
              occupation for hosting the Delegates‚Äô Assembly, for their
              hospitality, and for organizing this demonstration. We are deeply
              impressed by the level of organization in the Wroc≈Çaw occupation
              strike, which motivates us to take action. The National Strike
              Committee, which unites students working for Palestine from across
              Poland, is an initiative that allows us to strengthen ties beyond
              our individual universities and to exchange knowledge and
              experiences. We are deeply saddened that the formation of new,
              valuable connections and the pursuit of joint actions had to occur
              in the face of ongoing genocide in Palestine.
            </p>

            <p>
              We are one of the few delegations here that is not actively
              occupying the grounds of Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna≈Ñ.
              However, we organize demonstrations, peaceful sit-in protests, and
              participate in initiatives organized by allied Pozna≈Ñ collectives.
              Our protests are characterized by building new relationships,
              cultural exchange, and international solidarity. At the end of
              each demonstration, we learn Dabke, and with each meeting, we get
              better at it. The initiatives we organize are gaining more and
              more interest, which shows that the differences between
              Palestinians and Poles are mostly superficial.
            </p>

            <p>
              Over the past few months, we have taken many actions aimed at
              drawing the attention of our university‚Äôs rector, Professor
              Bogumi≈Ça Kaniewska, to the situation in Palestine, severing
              bilateral agreements with Israeli universities, and, most
              importantly, starting discussions and working with students to
              reach a mutual consensus. Our first letter was ignored, and all
              demonstrations in front of the main university building were
              disregarded. It even got to the point where the porter was
              instructed to open and close the rectorate doors for each person,
              out of fear that our peaceful protest might attempt to storm the
              building. A response from the rector finally arrived, but it was
              neither personally addressed to us nor personally issued by the
              Adam Mickiewicz University authorities. It was a joint statement
              issued by KRASP‚Äîthe Conference of Rectors of Academic Schools in
              Poland‚Äîsimply signed by Professor Bogumi≈Ça Kaniewska, who at that
              time served as the chair of the association. Perhaps if it hadn‚Äôt
              been for this fact, we would never have received any response.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then, the National Strike Committee was formed, which together
              issued the Academia for Palestine manifesto to KRASP.
            </p>

            <p>
              In recent months, we have observed how the rectors of Polish
              universities are cornering students who must resort to such
              decisive actions as occupation strikes to even gain the
              opportunity to enter into direct discussions with university
              authorities. The rectors themselves claim that these types of
              strikes harm the students the most because participating in
              protests disrupts the normal course of our studies. The time it
              would take from the rector‚Äôs schedule to participate in an open
              discussion with students is incomparable to the time and resources
              it requires of us as students to constantly protest to bring about
              such discussions. We should not have to resort to weeks-long
              occupations to force rectors to fulfill their obligations to
              students, which include (to quote) ‚Äòensuring [‚Ä¶] academic debate
              within the university, organized by members of the university
              community, with respect for ideological pluralism.‚Äô We interpret
              this as a recommendation that rectors be available when
              significant student issues require discussion, including when
              there are ideological differences between students and the
              university authorities. We are frustrated that despite the
              enormous sacrifices made by students and academics to create a
              credible and convincing narrative on the Palestinian issue, to
              analyze the history of Israeli colonization, and to find
              precedents supporting our position, we are not allowed to enter
              discussions where we could present the gathered arguments and
              demands. Unfortunately, the decision-makers in this matter‚Äîthe
              university authorities‚Äîeither display insufficient knowledge of
              the current situation of Palestinians or deliberately feign
              ignorance to justify their inaction and liberal approach to the
              topic of genocide. The goal of our actions is to humanize
              Palestinians in the eyes of Poles‚Äîwe want to show that the
              seemingly vast cultural differences between us do not make us
              fundamentally different categories of people. The issue of
              genocide in Gaza should be a matter on which opinions are not
              divided. We suspect that if we saw Palestinians as equal human
              beings, there would be no doubt that Israel‚Äôs actions should be
              called genocide‚Äîbut using that word in the first place requires us
              to recognize the humanity of Palestinians. Long live a free
              Palestine!"

            at representatives of the European Commission. Throughout the day,
            activists belonging to Academia for Palestine conducted a
            performance at the European Commission headquarters in Warsaw. At
            the Europa Experience center, they read a letter delivered to
            European Commission representatives across the EU. During this time,
            a die-in took place to remind everyone of Israel‚Äôs crimes against
            the Palestinian people. The hypocrisy of the European Union was
            exposed by displaying photos of bombed Gaza and the bodies of
            murdered Palestinians, juxtaposed with an exhibition portraying the
            EU as a defender of human rights. Dressed in attire reminiscent of
            Palestinian prisoners, the activists visually stripped away the
            image of a smiling Europe that remains passive or actively supports
            the crimes committed by Israel.

          <p>The sixth Arabic lesson took place on this day.</p>
          <p>
            At approximately 11:06 PM, a security officer from the university's
            property protection department entered one of the occupied rooms
            (Room 9), where a protesting individual was present. The officer
            began taking photos of the room and the person in it. Shortly after
            11:30 PM, an exchange occurred between the university's property
            protection officer and two protesting individuals. The individuals
            were in a room on the upper floor, while the officer was outside the
            building, accompanied by a third person. The conversation took place
            through an open window. The officer called the police to inquire
            about the legal consequences of being recorded on a mobile device
            without consent. He claimed that his image was being disseminated.
            The protesting individuals truthfully stated that they were not
            disseminating the officer's image. The officer also mentioned that
            the protesters were preventing him from entering rooms he was
            supposed to check and that they claimed to be occupying the rooms in
            question. He requested the police to come due to his inability to
            perform his duties. After the police received the report and the
            conversation ended, he said to the students, "It's high time to
            start taking action." The students informed the dean of the
            situation by phone.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few minutes later (around 11:56 PM), the police arrived and
            requested that at least one protesting individual come outside the
            building, so two protesters stepped out to speak with the officers.
            The officers were aware that they lacked the grounds to enter the
            university. They tried to understand the problem with the
            administrative staff member and asked for the legal basis of the
            ongoing occupation. A protesting individual presented the officers
            with the "Principles of the Peaceful Occupation Protest" dated June
            3, 2024, signed by both the University of Wroc≈Çaw authorities and
            the protesting students. The officer reviewed the principles and
            acknowledged that it was a binding agreement, and the occupation
            could not be deemed illegal. One of the protesters was identified by
            the officer. The administrative employee insisted that the officers
            enter the university building. One of the officers asked the
            protesters if they could reach an agreement with the employee or if
            the police needed to intervene on the premises. A protesting
            individual pointed out that the police had no right to enter the
            university grounds based on Article 50 of the Law on Higher
            Education and Science. They explained that the police could only
            enter the university building in specific cases, such as at the
            rector's request or without the rector's request in the case of an
            immediate threat to human life or health or a natural disaster. In
            the case mentioned in point 3, item 2, the services must immediately
            notify the rector of entering the university grounds. The second
            officer present acknowledged that the protesting individual was
            correct. The officer who had been asking questions walked away to
            make a phone call and confirm the information provided by the
            protester.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dean arrived and tried to calm the situation with the
            administrative employee. After the phone conversation, the officer
            informed both parties that the police indeed did not have the right
            to enter the university grounds and that a report of the
            intervention would be written. The second officer added that a legal
            demonstration was taking place on university grounds. The
            intervention was concluded by one officer stating, "Ladies and
            gentlemen, to be clear, you need to come to an agreement, have a
            conversation, this is not a matter for the police." The police then
            left. The dean, the protesting individuals, and the administrative
            employee went to the occupied building, where further attempts to
            calm the situation were made through individual conversations.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the conversation with the dean, the protesters noted that
            since the previous day at 10:00 PM, all doors, including those
            leading to the patio, had been locked. In the case of the
            outbuilding, locking all the doors equates to cutting off the
            evacuation route, and there is no way to contact the porter, who is
            in another building. The outbuilding houses a second porter
            responsible for the Institute of History, but contacting him is
            impossible due to the corridor doors leading to the floor where he
            works being locked. Moreover, the protesters were not instructed on
            what to do in case of an emergency involving the porter. The dean
            agreed that in the case of the outbuilding, this situation poses a
            safety risk to the protesters. He promised to speak with the porter
            to ensure that the outbuilding doors leading to the patio are not
            locked. After the conversation with the dean, the administrative
            employee unlocked the outbuilding doors leading to the patio.

        <h3><time datetime="2024-07-17">July 17, 2024</time>, Day 45</h3>
        <section>
          <p>
            At 11:00 AM in Room 29, a meeting was held with Ph.D. students,
            faculty from the Institute of Cultural Studies, and students
            occupying the University of Wroc≈Çaw (Szewska 50-51).
          </p>
          <p>
            During the meeting, the film "W ciemno" ("Out in the Dark") was
            screened.
          </p>
          <p>After the film, a discussion about its content took place.</p>
          <p>
            Around 1:00 PM, a lecturer from UWr specializing in the
            Palestine-Israel conflict joined the meeting. A discussion on the
            Palestinian issue was held.
          </p>
          <p>
            The discussion on the state of contemporary academia continued until
            4:30 PM.
          </p>
          <p>
            At around 4:30 PM, the protesters informed the remaining people in
            the room (two members of the Institute of Cultural Studies faculty)
            that they would not leave the room based on point 3 of the
            Principles of the Peaceful Occupation Protest (an agreement mutually
            signed on June 3, 2024, between the university authorities and the
            group of occupiers). The point includes "ensuring access to rooms
            and academic spaces for those participating in the protest action
            (...)". The occupation group decided to expand their area due to the
            increase in participants and the lack of sufficient space to
            function. The protesters decided to begin occupying another room in
            this manner because both the request to the Institute of Cultural
            Studies' director and the dean of the Faculty of Historical and
            Pedagogical Sciences had been rejected despite the aforementioned
            reasons for the need for a new room.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the occupation of Room 29 began, an administrative employee
            arrived and behaved aggressively toward the protesters. His behavior
            involved blackmail and threats, quoting his words: "If you want,
            I'll make your life so difficult that you'll be shocked." He
            referred to one of the non-white protesters as "a little blackie."
            The employee also took a fan from Room 29, which was the property of
            the protesters. He also removed a kettle and tea from the room.
            During the conversation with the protesters, he made phone calls to
            his superiors. Despite the protesters' attempts to start a dialogue,
            the administrative employee directed agitated and inappropriate
            remarks toward the students. The protesters tried to present him
            with the document containing the Principles of the Peaceful
            Occupation Protest, but he refused, stating that he knew its
            contents and that they had no significance.
          </p>
          <p>
            After 5:00 PM, another conversation took place between the occupiers
            and two administrative employees, who informed them that from July
            17, the Szewska 50 and 51 buildings would be closed, and the
            occupiers would not be able to move between the Institute of
            Cultural Studies building and the Institute of History building,
            which houses the Institute of Cultural Studies' annex. These spaces
            are designated for sleeping, eating, and working. The entire
            occupation group was split between the two buildings without the
            ability to move between them from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM. Due to the
            doors being locked, it was also impossible to sleep in the patio
            area, where two tents are set up, because there was no access to
            toilets and running water. Locking the doors is also concerning for
            the safety of those in the building. In our opinion, this is against
            health and safety regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            At around 9:00 PM, a Ph.D. student from the Institute of Cultural
            Studies appeared at the occupation site and informed the protesters
            that she was responsible for the key to the room. The occupiers had
            assumed that the key to Room 29 was held by a professor from the
            Institute of Cultural Studies. Considering the content of the
            Principles of the Peaceful Occupation Protest (point 2), employees
            of the university are guaranteed protection from reprisals or
            sanctions. However, aware that Ph.D. students are not employed by
            the university and therefore not covered by these principles, the
            protesters returned the key to Room 29 to the Ph.D. student but
            remained in the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the afternoon events, the lecture on imperialism scheduled
            for that day was postponed.

        <section>
          <p>
            At 1:00 PM, the Die-in for Life in Gaza protest took place,
            organized in collaboration with the Wroc≈Çaw for Palestine
            initiative. The event was performative, with participants lying on
            the cobblestones of Wroc≈Çaw's market square for half an hour,
            symbolizing the countless victims who die daily in Gaza. During the
            event, the following words were spoken:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              "I am a student at the University of Wroc≈Çaw. I am part of a group
              of people who have decided to express our opposition to the
              genocide being carried out by the Israeli government against the
              Palestinian people. For this reason, since June 3, we have been
              occupying the building of the University of Wroc≈Çaw. We demand
              from the university authorities what we believe to be extremely
              simple, unquestionable, and necessary for upholding ethical and
              moral principles. We demand the condemnation of genocide and the
              severing of ties with the perpetrator. However, this is 'too
              complicated,' 'too political,' and 'too hasty' for the university.
              We do not understand why, for an institution known for pacifism,
              openness to dialogue, allowing critical voices, and emphasizing
              its social responsibility, the bombing of hospitals, refugee
              camps, schools, universities, residential and commercial buildings
              in Palestine is not scandalous enough. Why does it remain silent
              when nearly 50,000 Palestinians have already been killed? Why is
              it not horrified by the unethical actions of Israeli universities
              with which it cooperates? Why does it not address the accusations
              of Israel violating international law?
            </p>
            <p>
              We would like to know the answers to these questions, but instead
              of dialogue, the Rector of the University of Wroc≈Çaw once again
              chooses passivity, silence, and delayed action. Even in the face
              of increasing pressure from the university community, he does not
              even attempt to explain the reasons that prevent him from speaking
              out and making appropriate decisions. There is no longer a
              university in Gaza; no one has access to education. In Israel,
              critical voices against government policies are being silenced,
              academic freedom has no place, and research results are being
              fabricated to support government policies. We, students,
              participants in a transnational academic exchange of ideas, want
              education that is free from prejudice, oriented towards truth,
              critical, democratic in its form, and carried out by scholars who
              understand their moral responsibility, who are aware of the social
              value of their knowledge. Now we know that we must constantly
              fight for such education because, in confrontation with reality,
              it becomes inconvenient. But no one taught us that comfort should
              be the virtue of a scholar. The burning world will not be
              extinguished by silence.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are students in a world that is on fire. The university is not
              the Rector's office; the real university is the relationships
              built during the occupation at Szewska 50/51. The real university
              is open to dialogue, and we are willing to talk. We invite you to
              Szewska 50/51 ‚Äì to the site of the peaceful occupation protest.
            </p>
            <p>No one is free until everybody is free."</p>

              Palestine.
            </li>
            <li>
              An appeal to member universities to sever ties with Israeli

              they collaborate with in this regard and the scope of such

            At 1:00 PM, the solidarity march "University of Wroc≈Çaw in
            Solidarity with Palestine" began at Plac Wolno≈õci. The march
            proceeded through Plac Solny and the Market Square, heading to
            Szewska Street and concluding at University Square. A speech was
            delivered on Szewska Street with the following content:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              "These words are a vote of no confidence in the authorities of
              this public institution:
            </p>
            <p>
              The university authorities do not trust the students; they do not
              believe in the validity of our actions because it directly strikes
              at the weak point of their narrative about what the university is.
              Apolitical‚Ä¶ Speaking of the university's apolitical nature, at
              this moment, is the most political statement one can hear. Further
              attempts to evade negotiations by invoking this apolitical stance
              are simply cynical.
            </p>
            <p>
              Suddenly, it turns out that students can read with comprehension
              and express critical opinions, and this alone seems to be enough
              to avoid engaging in dialogue with them. On the other hand,
              students do not understand why it is so difficult for our rectors
              to publicly condemn the crimes committed by the Israeli
              government‚Äîcondemning genocide is deemed to be political
              overreach. We are waiting for dialogue from those who promised us
              dialogue. We are waiting for talks in a place where dialogue is
              supposed to be foundational. We have been waiting for 29 days, and
              we will continue to wait until the university authorities
              recognize that condemning genocide is more important than
              legislative wrangling.
            </p>
            <p>
              We keep hearing that our cause is idealistic, that we are
              idealists. I would like to live in a world where condemning
              genocide is an act of realism. Where rejecting systemic
              dehumanization is an instinctive action driven by heart and
              conscience, not something filtered through the doubts, feeble
              words, and grotesque statements of those who are supposed to
              represent us‚Äîstudents. Idealists remain silent, struggling to
              reconcile what is with what could be. We act! And we will not stop
              acting!
            </p>
            <p>
              Stay strong! All the protesters and occupiers! We are strong
              together! Let‚Äôs take care of our solidarity!
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember, if they pat us on the back when we participate in
              history, it means we are standing on the wrong side of it.

            <p>
              In response to the letter addressed to the Rector, I would like to
              inform you that the university authorities maintain their position
              on the protest and once again request the immediate cessation of
              the occupation of the Faculty of Historical and Pedagogical
              Sciences‚Äô premises or, alternatively, the legalization of your
              chosen form of protest in the manner prescribed by the Higher
              Education Act (as stated in the letter addressed to you on June 7,

            We believe that since the beginning of our communication with UWr,
            we have been met with a lack of respect and a disdainful attitude
            towards our actions. We remind you that our protest is a response to
            the ongoing genocide in Gaza, and our act of protest is a stand
            against the actions of our local academic community.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the University of Wroc≈Çaw‚Äôs statute, we are part of the
            academic community and deserve to be heard!
          </p>
          <p>
            The only words directed towards us by the authorities are constant
            accusations of our actions being ILLEGAL! We would like to remind
            you once again of the agreement known as the Principles of the
            Peaceful Occupation Protest dated June 3, 2024, which was accepted
            and SIGNED mutually: both by the occupying students and by
            representatives of the University of Wroc≈Çaw's authorities.
          </p>
          <p>
            We take this agreement seriously and respect the dialogue that was
            established between the parties on that day (for the last time to
            date).
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not understand why, as protesting students who believe in the
            power of individual opposition to genocide, we are not being taken
            seriously."

              each other, and started exchanging views. The beginning of
              dialogue‚Äîcoming out of hiding‚Äîis already a significant event. One
              must lean forward, cross the threshold, extend a hand, and find a
              common place to talk."

            <p>J√≥zef Tischner, Ethics of Solidarity</p>
            <p>Your Magnificence,</p>
            <p>Dear Rector,</p>
            <p>
              Today (June 24, 2024) marks the third week since the occupation
              began at the University of Wroc≈Çaw, located at Szewska 50/51. We
              are deeply saddened by the fact that during these three weeks, we
              have not had the opportunity to begin discussions regarding our
              demands‚Äîknown to Your Magnificence since May 27, 2024, when we
              handed over the open letter. We hope that our invitations were not
              ignored due to a lack of willingness to engage in conversation and
              start an open dialogue, but rather due to the inability to meet
              with us at the proposed times. Therefore, we kindly ask the Rector
              to propose a day, time, and place that suits Your Magnificence for
              beginning talks with us‚Äîthe occupying students. We request that
              this meeting takes place within this week. We hope that during the
              next seven days, we will be able to meet, explain the importance
              of our demands, demonstrate the necessity of implementing them,
              and start a discussion towards finding a mutual agreement. We
              remind you once again that we will remain at Szewska 50/51, and
              delaying conversations with the students will not lead to a
              quicker end to the protest.

            A correction was sent regarding an article published on TVP3 (link
            in the correction).
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Dear All,</p>
            <p>
              It is unfortunate that we learn about the decisions of the
              University of Wroc≈Çaw‚Äôs Rector from the media. Given the continued
              disregard for our invitations to engage in dialogue, it seems we
              must communicate through other channels. Therefore, we feel
              obligated to address the statements we had the opportunity to read
              in yesterday‚Äôs article on TVP3 Wroc≈Çaw (link). We would like to
              remind the University authorities of our mutual agreements
              regarding the apolitical nature of the university, the legality of
              our protest, and the conclusions from the one conversation we had.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the article, we learn that the Rector of the University of
              Wroc≈Çaw will not fulfill the first of our demands‚Äîpublicly,
              firmly, and unequivocally condemning Israel‚Äôs attack on the Gaza
              Strip‚Äîarguing that, "Taking such a stance would be political." Let
              us recall the University of Wroc≈Çaw's 2022 statement regarding
              Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in which it was stated that
              "international scientific cooperation should be global and
              apolitical. It cannot, therefore, support the military actions of
              countries that threaten the existence of independent states." We
              fail to understand the "political" nature of a stance condemning
              genocide, cultural extermination, ethnic cleansing, and
              discrimination that the Palestinian people face. We do not
              understand why a firm opposition to such actions would be
              considered "political." We do not understand why the Rector is
              unable to explain this directly to us‚Äîthe protesting students‚Äîwhy
              we must read about such decisions in the media without the
              opportunity to discuss or address them.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the same article, the spokesperson mentions the alleged
              illegality of our protest. We would also like to correct this and
              remind the spokesperson of the agreements made between the
              protesting students and the University authorities, in which she
              was present and even proposed provisions included in the final
              agreement signed by a representative of the peaceful occupation
              and the Vice-Rector of the University of Wroc≈Çaw. On June 3, 2024,
              we jointly developed the Principles of the Peaceful Occupation
              Protest, which legitimized our presence at Szewska 50/51. We have
              repeatedly emphasized that we have not breached this agreement, we
              adhere to all its provisions, and we exercise the rights contained
              therein. Our protest, therefore, does not require legalization by
              the Student Government, the Students' Parliament of the Republic
              of Poland, or a national association representing only students.
              Once again, we emphasize: our protest was accepted and legalized
              by the Vice-Rector of the University of Wroc≈Çaw, who was acting on
              behalf of the Rector during his attendance at the Conference of
              Rectors of Polish Universities. Moreover, we believe that
              legislative wrangling in the face of the context and cause of our
              protest‚Äîopposing genocide‚Äîis at the very least inappropriate and
              certainly an attempt to divert attention from what should truly be
              the focus of our discussions. This is the fact that, in our view,
              every day of inaction and turning a blind eye to Palestine is
              tacit approval of genocide. The issue should not be the legal
              basis of the occupation but what is currently happening in the
              Gaza Strip.

              We would also like to remind the UWr spokesperson, who was present

              June‚Äîspecifically on May 27, 2024, during the handing over of the
              open letter to the Rector of UWr‚Äîthat this meeting was not of a
              negotiating nature. The Rector did not express a clear position on
              the students' demands, nor did we discuss them. Prof. Robert
              Olkiewicz informed us that he would discuss the content of the
              letter at the next rector‚Äôs board meeting‚Äîwe still do not know the
              outcome of those deliberations.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also want to remind you why we wrote in our communication to
              the media that we want to freely express our opinions, evaluate
              the university and its authorities, and ask to be allowed to
              criticize the university and its authorities and to be given the
              opportunity to believe that the University of Wroc≈Çaw is truly
              open to diverse viewpoints. In the email quoted in the article, we
              reminded you of the statement by the Rector of UWr, in which he
              said that at the university, "it‚Äôs about openness to different
              views, allowing criticism so that people can freely express their
              opinions and evaluate the university and its authorities."
            </p>
            <p>
              Your Magnificence, it is impossible to ignore our voice
              indefinitely. It will not be possible to continue communicating
              through media intermediaries; dialogue cannot be conducted through
              letters delivered by couriers. Please do not turn a blind eye to
              genocide; please do not allow cooperation with universities
              connected to military actions. Mr. Rector, let‚Äôs talk‚Äîin one
              office, not through media articles.

            At 5:00 PM, a demonstration titled ‚ÄúStrength in Unity! Academia for
            Palestine Wroc≈Çaw‚ÄîNational Protest Against Genocide and Occupation‚Äù
            took place. People in solidarity with the protest action at the

            Afterward, there was a meeting with law students who discussed
            higher education law and student rights.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another communication was also issued to the media regarding our
            renewed invitation to the Rector for negotiations. The message read
            as follows:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Dear All,</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Today, we once again requested Rector Robert Olkiewicz of the
              University of Wroc≈Çaw to begin talks with us‚Äîthe protesting
              students occupying the building at Szewska 50/51. We are now on
              the 17th day of the occupation, during which the Rector has
              refused and ignored our previous invitations. We do not understand
              why Prof. Olkiewicz is so afraid of dialogue, especially in light
              of the statements he made on Radio Rodzina shortly after assuming
              his position. When asked about how to resolve university tensions
              and disputes, he emphasized that the solution is "Above all,
              conversations. Conversations, calm conversations. Conversations
              with students, conversations with trade unions."
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not understand this sudden change of heart. We have assured
              and continue to assure that we will not leave Szewska Street until
              we reach an agreement with the University of Wroc≈Çaw's authorities
              regarding the condemnation of the Israeli government's actions in
              the Gaza Strip and the occupation of Palestine. An agreement
              cannot be reached without starting a dialogue. After all, the
              Rector himself said that at the university, "it‚Äôs about openness
              to different views, allowing criticism so that people can freely
              express their opinions and evaluate the university and its
              authorities." We want to freely express our opinions; we want to
              evaluate the university and its authorities. Allow us to engage in
              criticism. Let us believe that the University of Wroc≈Çaw is truly
              open to diverse viewpoints.
            </p>
            <p>
              We proposed to the Rector that the talks begin at 5:00 PM on
              Thursday, June 20, 2024. We have left the choice of venue to the
              University of Wroc≈Çaw‚Äôs authorities.

            While waiting for the public disclosure of information regarding the
            Israeli institutions with which the University of Wroc≈Çaw
            collaborates, a list of some of these institutions was published on
            the social media platforms covering the occupation. These
            institutions include:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Ben-Gurion University, which houses the Homeland Security
              Institute. Its partners are the largest Israeli weapons
              manufacturers and the Israeli Ministry of Defense. The Israeli
              military is building a technology campus alongside it, further
              strengthening the relationship between the university and the
              military. The university has also publicly accused employees who
              signed a statement against the genocide in Gaza of tarnishing the
              reputation of BGU.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tel Aviv University, responsible for developing the Dahiya
              Doctrine, which advocates the use of disproportionate force
              against civilian infrastructure.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which runs the Tai Pilot
              military program funded by the Israeli armed forces, training
              members of the Israel Defense Forces. The university is partially
              built on land illegally seized from the Palestinian population.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            At 6:00 PM, a lecture was held at the occupation site about Native
            Americans, their experiences with colonialism, and their perspective
            on the situation in Palestine. The discussion following the lecture
            focused on recognizing the parallels between colonial violence
            against the indigenous people of North America and the current
            mechanisms of oppression against the Palestinian population. Both
            examples constitute acts of genocide, including cultural genocide.

            Today at 1:00 PM, the "March for Gaza" took place, organized by
            Solidarno≈õci√≥wka, the group _Wroc≈Çaw dla Palestyny, and Wroc≈Çaw‚Äôs
            Food Not Bombs. The protest started at University Square 1, under
            the Swordsman monument, and ended at Plac Wolno≈õci. The
            demonstration also passed through Szewska Street to show solidarity
            with the occupying students. A speech was delivered from the
            windows:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              "We are here as the student community of the University of
              Wroc≈Çaw, who refuse to accept cooperation with institutions that
              support genocide and the university's inaction. We are here
              because we cannot stand idly by in the face of the tragedy
              unfolding in Gaza and the West Bank. For 13 days, we have been
              occupying three rooms and a patio in the buildings of the
              Institute of Ethnology and Cultural Anthropology, Cultural
              Studies, and History because our open letter with demands was
              completely ignored. We want to be heard; we want to engage in
              dialogue with the university authorities. However, in response, we
              only encounter attempts to intimidate us, to remove us from the
              building, and to hinder our actions. We cannot understand and are
              disappointed by the rector's indifference, who avoids direct
              contact. Lack of response is tacit approval of Israel's inhumane
              actions. We call for their immediate condemnation! We express
              solidarity with the students in Warsaw, who, to exert stronger
              pressure on the rector of the University of Warsaw, Alojzy Nowak,
              have moved their occupation to the main campus. The university
              authorities sent the police against their own students, who, using
              force, suppressed the peaceful demonstration and filed criminal
              charges. We are all fighting to stop the killing of Palestinians
              and are being treated like hooligans for it. We call on the
              authorities of Polish universities to fight against genocide, not
              against striking students! We are not leaving here until our
              demands are met. Every day of inaction is another day of allowing
              genocide to continue. It is another day marked by the deaths of
              defenseless people. It is another day that means the loss of more
              innocent lives. Never again, for anyone."

            On June 13, 2024, the occupation site received a letter from the
            Vice-Rector for Student Affairs, Dr. Hab. Maciej Cesarz, suggesting
            the illegality of the organized Palestinian Culture Day. Disagreeing
            with the content of the letter, the occupiers refused to sign for
            receipt of the document.
          </p>
          <p>
            The meetings held on June 13, 2024, were never intended as mass
            events but were simply a series of activities for the occupiers and
            invited guests, who, according to the Principles of the Peaceful
            Occupation Protest signed on the first day, have the right to freely
            enter and exit the occupation site during the building's formal
            opening hours.

            As part of Palestinian Culture Day, a series of activities took
            place aimed at affirming Palestinian culture, which has faced
            repression for decades. Being aware of the violent mechanisms aimed
            at eradicating Palestinian national and cultural identity, it is
            essential to cultivate the traditions of a nation that has faced
            oppression for decades.

            At 3:30 PM, a Palestinian poetry reading began on the patio. The

            brochures.
          </p>
          <p>
            At 5:00 PM, there was a presentation of _maqloubeh_‚Äîa traditional
            Arab dish, this time in a vegetarian version. The dish is prepared
            in a pot that is flipped upside down when served, hence the name of
            the dish, which literally means "upside down."
          </p>
          <p>
            At 6:00 PM, in room 4, conversations took place with people from

            At 7:00 PM, the second Dabkeh dance workshop was held with the
            Canadabkeh collective.

          <p>
            In the evening, an email was received stating that the list of

            On this day, the Wroc≈Çaw occupiers also expressed solidarity with

            two copies of his book _"Gaza in the 21st Century,"_ published in
            2024, and took the opportunity to answer a few questions about his

            in Wroc≈Çaw. From 1985 to 1992, he was part of the university
            community, studying Political Science. In an effort to spread
            awareness and knowledge about the Palestinian perspective and truth,
            we invite you to explore the work of Nidal Hamad.

            The first letter from the university authorities was delivered,
            signed by His Magnificence, the Rector of the University of Wroc≈Çaw,
            Prof. Dr. Hab. Robert Olkiewicz.
          </p>
          <p>
            The occupiers were accused of violating the terms of a mutually
            signed agreement (dated June 3, 2024). The principles were indeed
            violated, but by the university, not by the occupying students.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on what the occupying students consider to be an unfounded
            accusation, the Rector called on the protesting students to
            immediately leave the occupied area. The occupiers did not comply
            with this demand because, from their perspective, the agreement had
            not been breached in any way (the incident report was included in
            the entry from June 5, 2024).
          </p>
          <p>
            In response to the letter, the occupiers sent a message to the
            university, once again clarifying the incident of the breach of
            principles (by the employee of the occupied institute). The message
            also included an invitation for the Rector of the University of
            Wroc≈Çaw to enter into negotiations regarding the substantive
            demands.
          </p>

            At 6:00 PM, there was a screening of the film "A Fidai Film"
            directed by Kamal Aljafari.

            At 4:30 PM, an "Open House Lunch" was held for the protesters and
            invited guests who wanted to learn more about the occupation. The
            discussions focused on Palestine and the actions of the occupation

            On June 5, 2024, the Principles of the Peaceful Occupation Protest
            were violated by an employee of the Institute of Cultural Studies.

              ‚ÄúREPORT ON THE VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE PEACEFUL
              OCCUPATION PROTEST, Wroc≈Çaw, 5.06.2024‚Äù
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                On June 5, 2024, we did not receive any comments from the
                institute's authorities or the secretariat regarding the rooms
                or the inability to relocate classes. This means that all
                classes could have been held in different rooms (in accordance
                with the Principles of the Peaceful Occupation Protest). At
                10:00 AM, an employee of the Institute of Cultural Studies came
                to room 9 and informed two of the protesting individuals that
                relocating the room was impossible due to the lack of a
                projector (he stated that this was the only available
                projector). He said that the students would present two
                presentations as the semester was ending, and they needed to
                pass their courses before leaving for their home countries. The
                protesting individuals agreed.
              </li>
              <li>
                A person from Palestine was present in the room, who came to the
                occupation site to talk with the occupying individuals. The
                protesters were unable to have a conversation because they were
                being shouted over by the lecturer.
              </li>
              <li>
                After the two presentations, the lecturer proceeded to give a
                lecture, which was not in line with the previous agreement. He
                then announced a break.
              </li>
              <li>
                During the break, one of the protesting individuals checked the
                availability of rooms, and when it turned out that another room
                was available, the second protesting individual immediately went
                to the office of the institute's director. The office was
                closed. The dean was informed by phone. The dean arrived at the
                scene five minutes later and refused to interrupt the class.
              </li>
              <li>
                The entire situation was recorded by one of the students without
                the consent of the protesting individuals. After the class
                ended, as he was leaving the room, the student shouted
                Arabophobic slogans at the occupying individuals, which elicited
                no response from the lecturer, who was present at the time.‚Äù

          </blockquote>
          <p>
            The report of the incident was sent to the faculty, institute
            authorities, and the rector.
          </p>
          <p>
            At 5:00 PM, a lecture was given by Dr. Ahmed Elsaftawy titled
            "Palestine ‚Äì A Hidden History." Public awareness of the history of
            Palestine and the events that led to the occupation of Palestinian
            lands and the Nakba in 1948 is low. Therefore, it is encouraging
            that the occupation site serves as a space for presenting
            perspectives that are often silenced in the hegemonic narratives of
            the states contributing to the conflict.

            The second day of the occupation was focused on the internal
            organization of the group and spreading information about the
            students' activities in support of a Free Palestine.
          </p>
          <p>
            The occupied space was also organized. Room No. 9 was transformed
            into an information point for those interested in the activities of
            the occupation.
          </p>
          <p>
            A registration form was created for individuals who wanted to
            support the occupation with their knowledge, experience, or join the
            cultural-educational program, which was established due to the goals
            of the occupation, namely actions for a Free Palestine, actions
            leading to the fulfillment of substantive demands, and efforts to
            promote Palestinian culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rules of the occupation were posted in the courtyard of the
            Institute of Cultural Studies.
          </p>
          <p>
            At 6:45 PM, a meeting with Palestinians Sufian Kayyali, Maged
            El-Nakhalem, and Ahmed Elsaftawy took place at the Institute of
            Ethnology and Cultural Anthropology.
          </p>
          <p>
            At 8:15 PM, a communal poster and banner painting session was held
            in the courtyard.

        <section>
          <p>On June 3, 2024, the Student Peaceful Occupation Protest began.</p>
          <p>
            The occupation took over the building at ul. Szewska 50-51. Two
            rooms of the Institute of Cultural Studies, a room at the Institute
            of Ethnology and Cultural Anthropology, and the courtyard were
            occupied.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the start of the occupation (2:00 PM), the Manifesto of the
            Peaceful Occupation Protest was read aloud.
          </p>
          <p>
            The occupation began with the presence of the Wroc≈Çaw Samba.
            Palestinian flags and banners expressing the importance of the cause
            and the actions of the occupation were hung.
          </p>
          <p>
            An hour after the occupation began, representatives of the
            University of Wroc≈Çaw authorities arrived. Due to the absence of His
            Magnificence, the Rector of the University of Wroc≈Çaw, Prof. Dr.
            Hab. Robert Olkiewicz, the role of rector was assumed (on June 3,
            2024) by the Vice-Rector for Research, Prof. Dr. Hab. Artur
            B≈Ça≈ºejewski. The negotiations involved three representatives of the
            occupation and representatives of the UWr authorities (the press
            officer, the head of the communications department, and the
            vice-rector acting as the rector).
          </p>
          <p>
            After two hours of negotiations regarding the demands of the
            occupation, an agreement was signed (known as the Principles of the
            Peaceful Occupation Protest), which was discussed and mutually
            accepted. The document represents an acknowledgment of the students'
            presence in the occupied space until the fulfillment of the
            substantive demands or the conclusion of the peaceful protest, as
            well as the recognition of the protesters as a representation of a
            part of the academic community with the right to present their
            demands. The agreement also guaranteed the students and staff in the
            occupied area freedom from consequences and reprisals. The agreement
            includes provisions ensuring the occupiers' access to rooms and
            academic spaces, as well as access to media.
          </p>
          <p>
            The agreement between the UWr authorities and the Peaceful
            Occupation Strike was signed by the university authorities, with the
            signature of the Vice-Rector for Research, Prof. Dr. Hab. Artur
            B≈Ça≈ºejewski, and a representative of the occupation.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the evening, faculty and institute authorities visited the
            occupied area.
          </p>
          <p>
            Representatives of the University of Wroc≈Çaw's structures were
            informed about the mutually accepted rules of the occupation.
          </p>
          <p>At 5:00 PM, the manifesto was read aloud again.</p>

            On May 27, 2024, an open letter signed by over 1,300 people at the
            time of submission was handed to His Magnificence, the Rector, Prof.
            Dr. Hab. Robert Olkiewicz. Starting at 1:00 PM, a pro-Palestinian
            demonstration supporting the content and demands of the open letter
            took place at University Square. The meeting with the Rector of the
            University of Wroc≈Çaw was scheduled for 2:00 PM and lasted less than
            fifteen minutes. The students were presented with the rector's
            position, which aligned with the joint statement of Polish rectors
            (KRUP).
          </p>
          <h4>
            CONTENT OF THE OPEN LETTER to the Rector of the University of
            Wroc≈Çaw:
          </h4>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              We, the students of the University of Wroc≈Çaw, devastated and
              horrified by Israel's criminal actions against the Palestinian
              people, believe that it is time to stop waiting and watching the
              situation with fear and to start acting. For this reason, we have
              decided to draft an open letter to our university, in which we
              demand:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                A public, firm, and unequivocal condemnation of Israel's attack
                on the Gaza Strip and the occupation of Palestine,
              </li>
              <li>
                The immediate severance of cooperation with Israeli academic
                institutions, research centers, and other organizations and
                companies,
              </li>
              <li>
                The disclosure of information about which entities the
                University of Wroc≈Çaw collaborates with in this regard and the
                extent of such cooperation,
              </li>
              <li>
                A boycott of Israeli institutions at the national and
                international levels until the occupation of Palestine ends, the
                right of Palestinians to equality and self-determination is
                recognized, and the right of return for Palestinian refugees is
                acknowledged.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              The students who issued the open letter would also like to ask
              everyone for support (e.g., by signing the open letter). Anyone,
              not just students, can sign the open letter and share information
              about student actions for a Free Palestine.
